# Network Architecture/Structure 

* Development Computer: Used for coding, pushing changes, monitoring CI/CD.
* GitHub hosts your code and triggers workflows.
* MacMini Intel acts as:
   * 🐳 Docker Registry → stores your private images (embedded-ci:latest)
   * 📦 Package Storage → Python (PyPI mirror), CMSIS packs, APT repo
   * 🌐 HTTP File Server → hosts software installers & toolchains needed for Docker builds.
* GitHub Runners (self-hosted on Raspberry & MacMini) run jobs inside Docker containers that already contain software environements

# Workflow

## Code Static Analysis

Goal: Detect coding errors, undefined behavior, and style issues early.  
Scope: Source code analysis (host/target independent). Does not cover runtime behavior.  
Trigger: on every pull request & push to main  
Runner: ubuntu-latest  
Docker Image: myregistry.local/embedded-ci:cppcheck   
Software Environment: cppcheck, clang-tidy, clang-format  
Artifacts:    
```

```


```yaml

  # 0. Code Static Analysis
  CodeStaticAnalysis:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    container:
      image: myregistry.local/embedded-ci:latest   # <--- your custom Docker image
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Static Analysis
        run: cppcheck --enable=all --suppress=missingIncludeSystem src/
```

## Code Quality Analysis

Goal: Track maintainability metrics (LOC, complexity, duplication, coverage).  
Scope: Host-level source metrics, not target execution efficiency.  
Trigger: on pull requests  
Runner: ubuntu-latest  
Docker Image: myregistry.local/embedded-ci:quality  
Software Environment: cloc, pmccabe, lizard, gcovr
